        <h1>CHICKEN BIRYANI</h1>

        <h2><em>The Chicken Biryani the heavenly dish of India!</em></h2>
       <h3> <p>
            This is a delicious Pakistani and Indian rice dish which is often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan.
        </p>
          <p>  
               It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. 
          </p>
            <p>  For biryani, always use long grain rice. Basmati rice with its thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use. 
               <p> Ghee is butter that has been slowly melted
                 so that the milk solids and golden liquid have been separated and can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.
                 </p>
