        <h2><em>The dish which is the soul of Southern India</em></h2>
        <h3>
            <p>A dosa is a thin pancake or crepe originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. </p>
            <p>It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). </p>
            <p>Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. </p>
            <p>Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. </p>
            <p>Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. 
            Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder).</p>

            <li>1/2 kilograms boiled potato</li>
            <li>2 medium chopped green chilli</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mustard seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>salt as required</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup sliced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon refined oil</li>
            <li>10 leaves curry leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the batter and ferment overnight</strong>
                <p>Masala Dosa is one of the most popular South Indian delicacies. To prepare the batter for Masala Dosa, wash and soak the rice (with fenugreek added into it) and urad dal in separate containers for approximately 6-8 hours. </p>
                    <p> Once the rice and urad dal are soaked well, grind them separately in a mixer using the water in which they were soaked, till the mixture reaches a smooth consistency.
                    Mix the batter of both the ingredients in a bigger container and add salt to it. Combine well and allow it to ferment overnight.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the potato filling for Masala Dosa</strong>
                <p>To prepare the filling of the dosa, heat 2 tbsp oil in a thick-bottomed pan and let the mustard seeds splutter. Then, add sliced onions, curry leaves, green chillies and saute them till the onions turn pink.</p>
                   <p> Then, add a pinch of salt, turmeric powder and mix them well. Now, take the cubed potatoes and add them to the sauteed onions and mix them together. Pour water gradually into the mixture and allow the potatoes to simmer for around 4 minutes.
                    When the mixture is in semi-thick state, turn off the gas and let it rest for a few seconds.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pan fry your dosa on a dosa tawa</strong>
                <p>
                    Now, take a dosa tawa and heat it on low-medium flame. 
                    Smear 1 tsp oil on it to prepare the dosa. When the tawa is hot, pour and spread the batter evenly in a circular motion.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong> Add filling and fold the dosa</strong>
               <p>
                When the colour of dosa's edges turns into brown, reduce the flame and sprinkle few drops of oil on the dosa sides and put 2 tablespoons of filling.Fold the dosa. </p>
                <p>Repeat the process until all the batter and filling is used up. Serve hot Masala Dosa with coconut chutney and sambhar.
